# --- Required options --- #

# Name of website
title: SwiftPackage

# --- Logo --- #

# Image to show in the navigation bar - works best with a square image
# Remove this parameter if you don't want an image in the navbar
avatar: "https://iwill.im/images/ExCodable-1920x500.png"

# By default, the image is cut into a circle. You can disable this behaviour by setting 'round-avatar: false'
round-avatar: true

# If you want to have an image logo in the top-left corner instead of having the title of the website,
# then specify the following parameter
#title-img: /path/to/image

# --- Colours / background image --- #

# Alternatively, the navbar, footer, and page background can be set to an image
# instead of colour

#navbar-img: "/assets/img/bgimage.png"
#footer-img: "/assets/img/bgimage.png"
#page-img: "/assets/img/bgimage.png"

# For any extra visual customization, you can include additional CSS files in every page on your site. List any custom CSS files here
#site-css:
#  - "/assets/css/custom-styles.css"

# If you have common JavaScript files that should be included in every page, list them here
#site-js:
#  - "/assets/js/custom-script.js"
